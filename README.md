# Description
This is the main repo for Our Senior Design Project, which involves implementing NEAT on a video game, in this case MarioAI

# What is MarioAI?
MarioAI is a game written in Java for an AI Competition that was held from 2009-2012.  The website for the game can be found at http://www.marioai.org/

We have found a copy of the source code on github since the original was taken down, and we have forked it in order to implement our own AI on it.
